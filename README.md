# Sarcasm detection on Cross Domain Applications 
    This project propose the accuracy and efficiency of ML and NN models trained on one dataset and tested on other dataset. SARC dataset is used for taining and amazon     review dataset is used for testing the models. This enables Sarcasm detection on Cross Domain applications.
    - ## System Requirements
            1. Python 2.7
            2. Python package Gensim, NLTK, Keras,Matplotlib, Numpy, SkLearn, Pandas, Re, Tensorflow 2.0
    - ## Running the code
         - Get the Pre-requisites
           -Get the pre-trained GloVe file - [GLoVe.6d.100B.txt](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
### - Training and Evaluation
    **a. To run the ML models**
        Run python ML_Models.py

    **b. To run the NN models of Word2Vec NN models -**
      Run python word2Vec/Model_name.py
      Example to run LSTM model - run python Word2Vec/LSTM.py

    **c. b. To run the NN models of GloVe NN models -**
      Run python GloVe/Model_name.py
